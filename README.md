A Restaurant Review Database and WebApp

Project Description:

Your web application should be able to connect to the database and retrieve data from
it. You can use the tools you are most comfortable with. The image has preinstalled the
PostgreSQL system and a web server. The final deliverable is expected to:
  • Have a web-based graphical interface that will facilitate the communication with
  the database and the presentation of the contents.
  • Have the functionality to insert and delete data from the database. Specifically:
    o Insert/delete/update a restaurant
    o Insert/delete/update a user
    o Insert/delete/update a review
    o Insert/delete a checkin
  • Enable the interested user to ask arbitrary SQL queries.
  • Have a web-based interface that will execute the queries of part 2 and visualize
  the results.
