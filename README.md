A Restaurant Review Database and WebApp

Project Description:

Your web application should be able to connect to the database and retrieve data from <br>
it. You can use the tools you are most comfortable with. The image has preinstalled the <br>
PostgreSQL system and a web server. The final deliverable is expected to: <br>
  • Have a web-based graphical interface that will facilitate the communication with <br>
  the database and the presentation of the contents. <br>
  • Have the functionality to insert and delete data from the database. Specifically: <br>
    o Insert/delete/update a restaurant <br>
    o Insert/delete/update a user <br>
    o Insert/delete/update a review <br>
    o Insert/delete a checkin <br>
  • Enable the interested user to ask arbitrary SQL queries. <br>
  • Have a web-based interface that will execute the queries of part 2 and visualize <br>
  the results. <br>
